### Helper Functions for Package `osfr`

This package provides helper functions for `osfr` specific to the Ag division of the RBDC. These functions may be made more modular in future versions to apply to other `osfr` related projects.

Currently, `osfr` provides no way to interact with files which have not been manually viewed on the OSF. This package is allows a workaround for this utilizing file and folder WaterButler API links.
